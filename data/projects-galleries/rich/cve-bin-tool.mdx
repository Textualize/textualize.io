The CVE Binary Tool helps you determine if your system includes known vulnerabilities.
You can scan binaries for over 100 common, vulnerable components (openssl, libpng, libxml2, expat and others), or if you know the components used,
you can get a list of known vulnerabilities associated with a list of components and versions.
