Skedulord is a tool that automates scheduling and logging of cronjobs. It adds a retry mechanic,
simple logging configuration and like-able user interfaces to make cron just a bit more fun to work with.
It's mainly meant for Python users but it can also be used for other tools launched from the command line.

If you're curious about the UI, you can find a preview [here](https://koaning.github.io/skedulord-demo/).
