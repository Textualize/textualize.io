If these are common questions you encounter during your daily life as a researcher, then mle-monitor is made for you. It provides a lightweight API for tracking your experiments using a pickle protocol database (e.g. for hyperparameter searches and/or multi-configuration/multi-seed runs).

Furthermore, it comes with built-in resource monitoring on Slurm/Grid Engine clusters and local machines/servers.
