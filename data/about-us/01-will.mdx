I am the CEO / Founder of Textualize.

I've been working in tech for twenty five years now. I started out in video games, developing graphics technology for PCs and games consoles, but the last ten plus years I've spent working with Python. I combined both those skillsets when I wrote [Beginning Game Development with Python and PyGame](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4302-0325-4#:~:text=Beginning%20Game%20Development%20with%20Python%20and%20Pygame%20is%20written%20with,popular%20Pygame%20games%20development%20library.), published in 2007.

It's my love of Python that lead me to build several Open Source projects, notably [Rich](https://github.com/Textualize/rich) but also [PyFilesystem](https://www.pyfilesystem.org/) and [Textual](https://github.com/Textualize/textual).

I founded Textualize at the end of 2021, because of the increasing popularity of Rich and Textual. Here was an opportunity to take something we developers love (the terminal) and build something really exciting with it.
